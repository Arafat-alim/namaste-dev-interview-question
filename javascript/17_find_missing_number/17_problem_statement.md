# Problem name: `Find Missing number`

## Difficulties

- Easy

## Description:

You are given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from the range o to n. This means the array should ideally contain all numbers from to n, but one number is missing. Your task is to find and return that missing number.

## Input:

An array of n integers where each integer is unique and lies between and n (inclusive) except for one missing number.

## Output:

Return the missing number. Example Inputs & Outputs

```md
// Example 1:
Input: [3, 0, 1]
Output: 2

// Example 2:
Input: [0, 1]
Output: 2

// Example 3:
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8

// Example 4:

Output: 1
```

Constraints & Edge Cases
• The array contains exactly n numbers.
• All numbers are unique.
• Numbers are in the range to n.
• Only one number is missing from the sequence.
• The array may be in any order.
