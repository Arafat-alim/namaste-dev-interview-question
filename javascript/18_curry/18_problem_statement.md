# Problem name: `Currying`

## Difficulties

- Easy

## Description:

Create a curry function that accepts a function fn and returns a curried version of it. The curried function should accept arguments one at a time, and once all arguments are received (based on the original function's arity), the original function should be executed.

## Example Inputs & Outputs

```md
function sum(a, b, c) {
return a + b + c;
}

const curriedSum = curry(sum);

curriedSum(1)(2)(3); // → 6
curriedSum(1, 2)(3); // → 6
curriedSum(1)(2, 3); // → 6
curriedSum(1, 2, 3); // → 6
```

## Constraints & Edge Cases

- The input fn can have any number of parameters.
- The curried function must handle partial application (passing fewer args in one call).
- It should support chaining until all arguments are passed.
- If fn takes O arguments, it should return the result of calling fn().
